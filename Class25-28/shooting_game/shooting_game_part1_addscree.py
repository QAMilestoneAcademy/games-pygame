import pygame

#Initiate Pygame
pygame.init()

##game goes here##
#first create display surface- the window being displayed for the player
screen=pygame.display.set_mode((1280,720)) #specify the width & height of screen in pixels
##A pixel is represented by a dot or square on a computer monitor display screen. Pixels are the basic building blocks of a digital image or display and are created using geometric coordinates.

#Game loop - Updates the display surface & draws on it regularly(literally like while loop)
#check events- events are mostly inputs from a player like pressing a button


#quit pygame
pygame.quit()
