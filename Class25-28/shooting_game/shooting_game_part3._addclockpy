import pygame,sys #inbuilt module

#Initiate Pygame

##game goes here##
#first create display surface- the window being displayed for the player
screen=pygame.display.set_mode((980,540)) #specify the width & height of screen in pixels
#to solve the problem of frame rate consistency
clock=pygame.time.Clock()
##A pixel is represented by a dot or square on a computer monitor display screen. Pixels are the basic building blocks of a digital image or display and are created using geometric coordinates.

#Game loop - Updates the display surface & draws on it regularly(literally like while loop)
#check events- events are mostly inputs from a player like pressing a button
while True:
   #to close window on clicking close button-pygame keeps on checking all events until it meets quit event
   for event in pygame.event.get():
       if event.type==pygame.QUIT:
           pygame.quit()#only closes pygame as a module
       #to close pygaame fully
           sys.exit()#closes program fully

    #to continuously update screen
   pygame.display.update()
   clock.tick(120)#this fixes framerate and hence speed of display update
